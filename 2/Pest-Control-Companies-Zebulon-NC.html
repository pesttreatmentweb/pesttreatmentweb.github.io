Pesticides not contained in baits or traps need to usually only be used to targeted places, not sprayed over the entire space. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a philosophy that includes the management of a pest rather of managing or getting rid of a pest. TAP insulation for attics, moisture barriers for crawl areas, and specially crafted weather removing for garage and entry doors not just discourage rodents and other damaging pests from going into and living in your home, they're energy effective, too.</p>
