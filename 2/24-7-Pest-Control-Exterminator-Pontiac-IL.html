Early detection of arthropod pests helps avoid the need to handle extensive populations that might cause crop damage. Security problems and eco-friendly disturbances continue to take place (Wright, 1996 ), and there are restored appeals for efficient, safe, and financially appropriate alternatives (Benbrook, 1996 ). Artificial chemical pesticides are the most widely used technique of pest control.</p>
