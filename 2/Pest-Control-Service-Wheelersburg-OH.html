<p>Pests can become a costly issue for your business if left to their own devices. If more tracking, recognitions and action thresholds show that less risky controls are not working, then extra pest control techniques would be employed, such as targeted spraying of pesticides. However excellent the results of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) might be, it is only fair to state that worldwide, its implementation in farming is still in its infancy, and we are a long way from understanding whatever that goes on in and around the crops we grow for food.</p>
