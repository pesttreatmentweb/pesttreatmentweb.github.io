<p>These unidentified or inadequately understood potential threats argue for additional levels of protection including direct exposures to several pesticides, at home, at school and in the diet; exposure to chemicals in combination with pesticides such as pharmaceuticals, commercial substances and individual care products; and the basic trouble in associating persistent diseases to any one specific cause.</p>
