Furthermore, numerous collecting practices prevent natural enemies from persisting in yearly crops. When compared to insecticide-treated traditional fields, natural opponent abundance and biological control are considerably improved in Bt crops. Learning about the pests you have and choices that are offered to control specific pests is the primary step.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural enemies and dissuade pest determination consist of intercropping (multiple crops in the same field) to make it harder for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which bring in pests far from harvest crops and which can later on be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to coincide with times where pests have actually emerged and died off for the season.</p>
