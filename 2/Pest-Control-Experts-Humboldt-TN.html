<p>4 ). With its success in many parts of the world, IPM is considered as a ecologically benign and cost-effective  pest control method ideally suited for both small and large farmers worldwide. As soon as termites have actually gotten in a building, they do not limit themselves to wood; they also damage paper, cloth, carpets and more.
