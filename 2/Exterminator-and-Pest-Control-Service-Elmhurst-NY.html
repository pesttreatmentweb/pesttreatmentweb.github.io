<p>We got 195 points out of 200 in Integrated Pest Management. Pests are attracted to a number of areas that can provide any of thefollowing: food, water, shelter or all 3. If a number of the pests are killed, then any that have resistance to the chemical will form the genetic basis of the future, more resistant, population. While chemical pesticides must be used as the last resort, in concept, sometimes they are the very first line of defense to avoid the area-wide spread of specific endemic or invasive pests and diseases or to secure the seed and transplants from typical and persistent pest issues.</p>
