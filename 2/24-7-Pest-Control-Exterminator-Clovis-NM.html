<p>4 ). With its success in lots of parts of the world, IPM is considered as a cost-efficient and environmentally benign pest control method ideally suited for both little and big farmers around the world. When termites have actually gotten in a building, they do not limit themselves to wood; they also damage paper, cloth, carpets and more. In some ways, IPM can be viewed as a decision-making procedure in which observations (from evaluation and tracking) are used to make pest control decisions based on pre-determined management objectives.</p>
<p>Tighter regulations for food security, occupational health and safety, and the environment mean in-house pest control isn't an alternative for lots of food businesses these days. Farmers are confronted with myriad of production obstacles where the most typical problems are pests, that include insects, weeds, and illness. Likewise, pest and crop management disciplines should work together to develop control recommendations that reflect these interactions.</p>
<p>Integrated pest management implies careful consideration of all offered plant defense methods and subsequent combination of suitable procedures that discourage the advancement of populations of damaging organisms and keep the use of plant security items and other types of intervention to levels that are economically and environmentally justified and reduce or minimise risks to human health and the environment.</p>
