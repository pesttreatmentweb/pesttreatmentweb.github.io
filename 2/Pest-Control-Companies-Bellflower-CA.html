<p>In Asia, different stages of IPM have actually been effectively embraced in Bangladesh (rice), China (cotton, fruit crops, maize, rice, soybean, veggies), USA (cotton, fruit crops, sugarcane, vegetables), Indonesia (rice), Korea (rice), Malaysia (veggies, plantation crops), Pakistan (cotton, mango, sugarcane), Philippine (rice), Tadjikistan (cotton), Thailand (cotton), Turkmenistan (cotton), Vietnam (rice) (Tables 6 and 8, Ooi et al. 1991, Raheja 1995, Morse & Buhler 1997).</p>
<p>As part of the Sustainable Use Directive on Pesticides, professional users of pesticides are required to consider the concepts of IPM before using chemicals. Biological pest control is an approach of managing pests such as insects and mites by utilizing other organisms 8 It depends on predation, parasitism, herbivory or other natural systems, but usually also involves an active human management role.</p>
<p>Numerous more recent pesticides are derived from plants or naturally taking place compounds (e.g.-- insect, nicotine and pyrethrum juvenile hormone analogues), however the toxophore or active component may be altered to provide increased biological activity or stability. If we cultivate crops according to the idea of Integrated Pest Management (IPM), a lot of scientists agree that this will be possible only.</p>
<p>Effective, less risky pest controls are picked first, consisting of highly targeted chemicals, such as pheromones to disrupt pest breeding, or mechanical control, such as trapping or weeding. Evaluation is often one of the most essential actions in Integrated Pest Management (Bennett et al., 2005 ). It is the procedure of reviewing an IPM program and the outcomes it has created.</p>
