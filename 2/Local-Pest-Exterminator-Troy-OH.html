Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to draw in and vacuum the western ruined plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been suggested as an IPM method by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the concept did not take off because growers were not all set for such an intercropping plan. If your facility currently uses an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you won't be amazed to hear that the pest control market has and will continue to move toward least-impact product or services.</p>
