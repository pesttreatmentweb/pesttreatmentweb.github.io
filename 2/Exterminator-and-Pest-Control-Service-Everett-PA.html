<p>Pesticide hazards consist of acute, immediate toxicity to human beings and other non-target organisms; persistent or long-lasting toxicity such as cancer; and environmental contamination of the air, or ground and surface area water.

<p>Many newer pesticides are originated from plants or naturally happening substances (e.g.-- pest, nicotine and pyrethrum juvenile hormonal agent analogues), but the toxophore or active component may be altered to supply increased biological activity or stability. A lot of researchers concur that this will be possible only if we cultivate crops according to the concept of Integrated Pest Management (IPM).</p>
<p>Under this plan, insect control was "monitored" by certified entomologists and insecticide applications were based on conclusions reached from routine monitoring of pest and natural-enemy populations. We can treat a big variety of pests found in Texas, including spiders, ants, termites, fleas, ticks, roaches, bed bugs, rodents and other invaders. Sprays, are best used versus flying pests and biting pests, such as fleas Most insects will die within minutes of entering into contact with an insecticide spray, but some persistent bugs may make you spray the location several times prior to quiting.</p>
