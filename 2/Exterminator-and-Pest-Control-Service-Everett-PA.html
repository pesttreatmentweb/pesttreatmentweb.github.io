<p>Pesticide hazards consist of acute, immediate toxicity to human beings and other non-target organisms; persistent or long-lasting toxicity such as cancer; and environmental contamination of the air, or ground and surface area water.

<p>Many newer pesticides are originated from plants or naturally happening substances (e.g.-- pest, nicotine and pyrethrum juvenile hormonal agent analogues), but the toxophore or active component may be altered to supply increased biological activity or stability. A lot of researchers concur that this will be possible only if we cultivate crops according to the concept of Integrated Pest Management (IPM).</p>
<p>Under this plan, insect control was "monitored" by certified entomologists and insecticide applications were based on conclusions reached from routine monitoring of pest and natural-enemy populations. We can treat a big variety of pests found in Texas, including spiders, ants, termites, fleas, ticks, roaches, bed bugs, rodents and other invaders.
