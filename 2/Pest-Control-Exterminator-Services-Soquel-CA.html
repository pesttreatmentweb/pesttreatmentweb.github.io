Particular biostimulants based on minerals, microorganisms, plant extracts, seaweed or algae impart induced systemic resistance to pests, diseases, and abiotic stressors, but are applied as modifications without any claims for pest or disease control (Larkin 2008, Vleesschauwer and Höfte 2009, Sharma et al. 2014, López-Bucio et al 2015, Dara 2018a ).
