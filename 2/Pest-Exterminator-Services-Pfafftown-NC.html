<p>IPM approaches include both chemical and nonchemical ways to avoid and control pest populations from reaching economically harmful levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the smallest effective dose when other techniques of pest control have failed.

<p>There are numerous pest control companies situated all over the city, that is why, is necessary to know which one is the best in order to avoid being cheated by any average company. Home pests can include insects such as cockroaches, flies and mosquitoes, or rodents like mice or rats.

<p>Other approaches include hand picking of pests, sticky boards or tapes for control of flying insects in greenhouses and various trapping techniques. IPM takes advantage of all proper pest management options including, but not limited to, the cautious use of pesticides. Our house pest control services are developed to secure you year-round from problem trespassers such as ants, cockroaches, spiders and other family pests for Greater Houston-Galveston house owners.</p>
