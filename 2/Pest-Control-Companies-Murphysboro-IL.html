<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural enemies and dissuade pest determination consist of intercropping (multiple crops in the same field) to make it more difficult for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which draw in pests away from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to coincide with times where pests have emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
<p>Natural enemies such as parasitic wasps and predatory arthropods can be very effective in causing substantial decreases in pest populations in specific circumstances (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ). Periodical releases of commercially available natural opponents or saving natural opponent populations by providing refuges or avoiding practices that hurt them are a few of the common practices to control endemic pests.</p>

Non target species like natural opponents of pest get affected.
