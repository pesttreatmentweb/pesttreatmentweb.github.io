<p>Biological control has been effectively utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address invasive pest problems, classical biological control approach is normally utilized where natural opponents from the native area of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the brand-new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control technique that has been efficiently used versus a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>This method of pest control has fallen out of favour in current years considering that fire eliminates useful insects together with the pests and can have an unfavorable effect on the soil. To reduce possible damage to beneficial insects, limit your spraying to little areas where you can see pests hiding, and leave a couple of unsprayed "refuges" for any great bugs you can't see.</p>
