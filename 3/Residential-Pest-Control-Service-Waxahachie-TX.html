<p>Socio-psychological elements including moral and reasonable factors to consider were discovered to the chauffeurs in IPM implementation in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka showed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or illness incident and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey performed by Parsa et al. (2014) likewise revealed that an absence of qualified IPM professionals and extension teachers was an impediment for IPM execution in developed nations.</p>
<p>Monitoring and recognition minimizes the dangers of utilizing the incorrect kind of pesticide, or utilizing pesticides when other techniques will be more efficient. The advantage of the fogging pest control technique is that it's thought about to be eco-friendly, it's odor-free and doesn't leave any residues that are challenging to be cleaned up.

After handling numerous national chain exterminators and being largely disappointed with the service, I turned to Terminators for aid with pest problems at my place of business.
