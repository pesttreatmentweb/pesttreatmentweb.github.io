The very first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, correct watering and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM considers the ecosystem as a whole and considers a well balanced mix of the previously mentioned control approaches to produce the most reliable and least destructive strategy.</p>
<p>Although botanical extracts such as azadirachtin and pyrethrins, and microbe-derived poisonous metabolites such as avermectin and spinosad are considered as biologicals (Lasota and Dybas 1991, Sarfraz et al. 2005, Dodia et al. 2010 ), they are still chemical particles, similar to artificial chemicals, and possess much of the human and environmental security threats as chemical pesticides.</p>

<p>Kaolin particle films used in natural farming might control some pests, but can negatively affect natural opponents and trigger other pests to proliferate (Markó et al. 2008 ). Organic farming practices may motivate natural enemy populations, however a greater variety of natural opponents does not constantly lead to pest suppression (Dara 2014 ).
