The new ribonucleic acid disturbance (RNAi) technology where double-stranded RNA is applied to silence specific genes in the target bug is thought about as biopesticide application (Gordon and Waterhouse 2007 ). Specific biostimulants based on minerals, microorganisms, plant extracts, seaweed or algae impart induced systemic resistance to pests, diseases, and abiotic stress factors, but are used as amendments with no claims for pest or illness control (Larkin 2008, Vleesschauwer and Höfte 2009, Sharma et al. 2014, López-Bucio et al 2015, Dara 2018a ).

<p>On the other hand, organic food production applies a number of the very same principles as IPM but restricts the use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, as opposed to artificial chemicals.
