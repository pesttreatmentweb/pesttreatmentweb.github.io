<p>The brand-new ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) technology where double-stranded RNA is used to silence specific genes in the target insect is thought about as biopesticide application (Gordon and Waterhouse 2007 ). Particular biostimulants based upon minerals, microbes, plant extracts, seaweed or algae impart induced systemic resistance to pests, illness, and abiotic stress factors, but are used as changes with no claims for pest or illness control (Larkin 2008, Vleesschauwer and Höfte 2009, Sharma et al. 2014, López-Bucio et al 2015, Dara 2018a ).
