<p>Appropriate scouting also provides information that help to quantify the development of pests and natural opponents. In time, with the glue-board monitoring program and insect submissions, the committee will end up being knowledgeable about the types of pests encountered in the building and the dynamics of the populations.

Non-chemical approaches of pest prevention can be carried out in-house to successfully and securely avoid infestations. In addition, pests control companies take care of everything, consisting of clearing out the dead pests. Earlier designs of integrated pest management (IPM) concentrated on environmental elements of pest management.</p>
