<p>We traditionally have offered nature short, both in its capability to neutralize the effectiveness of environmentally unsound techniques along with its array of intrinsic strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds. For instance, pressures of predaceous mites, rove beetles, lacewings, and types of parasitoids have been selected for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, therefore increasing the likelihood that some will endure insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
