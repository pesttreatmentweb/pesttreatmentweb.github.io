IPM programs initial task is to develop appropriate pest levels, called action limits, and apply controls where the thresholds are crossed.

Modern crop ranges often accidentally develop conditions which prefer pest types (e.g., pest species which have actually bored deeper into larger fruit making them unattainable to natural opponents). Expect SARS-CoV-2 to behave like an invasive types introduced to a new area when resources are plentiful (that is, individuals without resistance) and there are no biological controls to keep the population in check or registered items to use in management (such as federally approved medications).</p>
