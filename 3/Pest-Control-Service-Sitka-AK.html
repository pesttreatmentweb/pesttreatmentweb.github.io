<p>Socio-psychological factors including reasonable and moral considerations were discovered to the chauffeurs in IPM execution in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A survey of veggie growers in Sri Lanka showed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or disease event and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A study performed by Parsa et al. (2014) likewise revealed that an absence of qualified IPM experts and extension educators was an impediment for IPM implementation in developed countries.</p>
<p>The approach to be picked for IPM depends upon numerous elements, the essential of which are nature of target pest, the environment, and financial aspect of the management.

Applications of pesticides need to reach their intended targets. But there are a lot of pest control companies out there in Sitka and they all have different level of quality and service requirement, so naturally there charge in a different way.</p>
