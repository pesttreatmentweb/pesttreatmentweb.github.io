Pesticides load powerful and essential punches, especially when other IPM controls fall short. The Voluntary Effort Integrated Pest Management Plan (IPMP) can be completed by any farm or nursery business using professional pesticides to produce crops, ornamentals, fodder or feed.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural opponents and prevent pest persistence include intercropping (multiple crops in the same field) to make it harder for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which draw in pests away from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to accompany times where pests have actually emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
<p>Termites eat furnishings, documents, books, and even documents kept in safes and lockers, therefore causing enormous damage within simply a few months. This stops the pest acquiring resistance to chemicals produced by the plant or used to the crops. Exterminators go to customer houses and businesses to inspect for insects or rodents. Classical biological control involves introducing natural opponents from a pest's native variety into a new location where native natural opponents do not supply control.</p>
