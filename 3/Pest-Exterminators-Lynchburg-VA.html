Our online courses include Crop Pest Diagnostics and Management, as well as the first-ever web-based hygienic and phytosanitary procedures curriculum (sponsored by USAID). Integrated pest management requires an understanding of the ecology of the cropping system, consisting of that of the pests, their natural enemies, and the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>When stored for a long time, stored item pests are most likely to be in a food ingredient on shipment to a processing factory or a processed food item. Applying pesticides to crops, animals, buildings or landscapes on a regular basis, despite requirement, is not IPM.
