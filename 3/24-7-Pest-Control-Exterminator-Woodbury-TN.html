<p>Properly determine pests and beneficials on sticky cards and plants. The knowledge of different control options, pest biology and damage potential, and suitability of readily available resources allows the grower to decide appropriate for their scenario. Greenhouses provide an appropriate environment (e.g., temperature level and light) for many biological control agents or natural opponents including parasitoids, predators, and entomopathogenic nematodes.</p>
<p>Because of their prospective damage to pest control employees, clients, and the environment, restricted-use pesticides are heavily controlled by Federal law. Fungi: Beauveria bassiana is used for control of lepidopterous pests. The interactions between crop and pest (in addition to the environment) are very essential. Promotion of natural enemies: Not using pesticides and diversifying crops benefits natural enemies of cotton pests such as birds, ladybirds, beetles, spiders, parasitic wasps, ants and bugs.</p>
<p>As the name recommends, insecticides are chemical items developed to kill insects, such as ants, cockroaches, and flies.
