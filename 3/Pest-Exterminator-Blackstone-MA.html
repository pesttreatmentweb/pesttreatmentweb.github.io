The very first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, use of resistant varieties, proper irrigation and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM thinks about the ecosystem as an entire and takes into consideration a balanced mix of the abovementioned control techniques to produce the most effective and least harmful strategy.</p>
<p>In recommendation to the concept of integrating making use of other and biological controls in complementary methods, the term was later widened to embrace coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962).

Recent quests for efficient, safe, and enduring pest management programs have been targeted primarily toward development of brand-new and better products with which to change standard harmful pesticides.</p>
