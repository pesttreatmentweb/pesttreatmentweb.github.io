<p>Pesticides are selected and used in such a way that reduces their possible damage to people, nontarget organisms, and the environment. IPM is most likely to be misinterpreted as pest management without chemicals which in truth need based use of chemicals. Pests can be brought into the food processing facility through the supply chain, in the active ingredients or packaging, and the facility itself will attract pests through food smells and lighting.</p>
<p>Without controls on population growth, organisms can quickly attain levels at which damage is triggered therefore ending up being pests (e.g., locust swarms stripping landscapes bare). For instance, a rich community likely will have a great deal of big, costly houses, so pest control expenses could be greater there since there's more territory for a pest control company to cover in one of those houses.</p>
