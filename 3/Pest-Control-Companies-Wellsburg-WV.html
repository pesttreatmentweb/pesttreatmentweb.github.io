Pest exclusion with netting or row covers, vacuuming or handpicking to eliminate pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, modifying environmental conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sanitation or solarization, visual or physical bird deterrents such as reflective product or sonic devices are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>
