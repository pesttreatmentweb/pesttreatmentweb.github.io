<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, use of resistant varieties, proper watering and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM thinks about the community as an entire and takes into consideration a balanced mix of the aforementioned control techniques to produce the most reliable and least harmful strategy.</p>
<p>Recent studies document the need for continued decreases in harmful pesticide usage and practices. Although the basic components of IPM are always the exact same, the specific components of an IPM program vary from one environment or scenario to another. Application of predatory mites against thrips in potted plants is more reliable when done prior to spacing the plants.</p>
<p>The concept has been around since the 1920's when cotton pest management program was established. Pest control companies know the ideal pesticide to use in any circumstance, this conserves a great deal of expenses. Poisoning by exposure to pesticides may take place shortly after a single exposure (intense poisoning) or gradually after duplicated exposures over an amount of time (chronic poisoning).</p>
