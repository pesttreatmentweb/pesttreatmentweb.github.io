Many insect pest species now have resistance to some or a number of kinds of insecticides, and few chemical control choices exist for these pests.</p>
<p>We historically have sold nature short, both in its capability to neutralize the effectiveness of environmentally unsound methods in addition to its variety of inherent strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds. For example, stress of predaceous mites, rove beetles, lacewings, and types of parasitoids have been picked for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, consequently increasing the likelihood that some will endure insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
<p>Natural opponents such as predatory arthropods and parasitic wasps can be very effective in causing considerable reductions in pest populations in certain situations (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ). Periodical releases of commercially available natural opponents or conserving natural enemy populations by supplying sanctuaries or preventing practices that damage them are a few of the typical practices to control endemic pests.</p>
