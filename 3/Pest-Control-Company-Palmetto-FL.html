<p><img src="https://pestimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/pest-treatment.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Ticks and fleas are 2 of the most regular pet care issues in America. Pests managed: Yellow traps draw in whiteflies, fruit flies, male winged scales, leafhoppers, fungi gnats, midgets, male winged mealybugs and leafminers, thrips, psyllids, and winged aphids. The more plants or places inspected, the more likely the sooner an issue will be discovered, when management is most convenient. The goal was to improve the health and ecological conditions of INDIA by offering professional pest control service at competitive costs.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural enemies and discourage pest perseverance consist of intercropping (multiple crops in the exact same field) to make it harder for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which draw in pests away from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to accompany times where pests have emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
