In numerous developing countries, where IPM is now governmental policy, pesticide use is being minimized.</p>
<p>Termites are such damaging pests that you desire your termite treatment to lead to termite extermination. When monitoring, action, and recognition limits show that pest control is required, and preventive methods are no longer reliable or readily available, IPM programs then examine the correct control method both for efficiency and danger.
