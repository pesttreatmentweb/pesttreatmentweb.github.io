<p>By establishing a customized Integrated Pest Management program for your garden, you can take action-- with the ideal controls-- when pests show up, and after that rest simple. Consideration of crop plants as active components of multitrophic level interactions is crucial to an overall systems approach to pest management. Commercial pest control companies have responsibilities that go far beyond that of managing and getting rid of pests.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural enemies and discourage pest persistence consist of intercropping (several crops in the very same field) to make it more difficult for pests to discover a host plant, planting trap crops which attract pests far from harvest crops and which can later be treated with choose application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to accompany times where pests have actually emerged and died off for the season.</p>

Farmers are confronted with myriad of production difficulties where the most common issues are pests, that include diseases, insects, and weeds.
