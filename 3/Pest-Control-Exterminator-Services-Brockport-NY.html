<p>Part of this success originated from field schools which enabled regional farmers to harness their indigenous knowledge of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997). IPM is the choice and usage of pest control actions that will guarantee beneficial economic condition, social and environmental consequences 13 and is applicable to many agricultural, public health and facility pest management scenarios.</p>
<p>Typical pest like bed bugs, cockroaches, termites, mosquito etc can be so excruciating sometimes that the only alternative left is to employ a regional pest control company to eliminate pests. If a professional pest control firm is under contract to an institution, the technician will commonly spray pesticides around the border of different spaces. Thus, integrated pest management implies that areawide and long-term approaches can be important.</p>
<p>Natural opponents such as predatory arthropods and parasitic wasps can be extremely effective in triggering considerable reductions in pest populations in certain circumstances (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ). Periodical releases of commercially offered natural enemies or saving natural opponent populations by supplying havens or avoiding practices that damage them are some of the common practices to control endemic pests.</p>
