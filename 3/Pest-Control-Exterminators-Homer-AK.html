The pest management market is large, with over 15,000 companies serving the public and roughly 150,000 pest control service workers. Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, vermins, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow coats, flies and bees are frequently discovered pests in our society.</p>
