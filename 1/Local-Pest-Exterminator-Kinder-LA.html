<p>Dorchester County runs a Mosquito Control Program to safeguard its people from the spread of mosquito-borne diseases by spraying pesticides (insecticides), using larvicide to low-lying locations, and informing its residents on decreasing the conditions that promote boosts in the mosquito population. This combination of IGRs can be effective in preventing re-infestation of pests such as cockroaches. SWPM is vulnerable to attack by wood boring insects which, in a collection environment, may cause major damage to structures, office furniture, artifacts and specimens. Applicators perform more complicated jobs, have the ability to use a wider variety of pesticides, and may concentrate on a particular area of pest control.</p>
<p>Early detection in many cases can help attend to the pest scenario by low-cost spot treatment or removal of pests or plagued or contaminated plant material.
