<p>Biological pest control steps take advantage of the hierarchy within nature. IPM programmes preliminary job is to develop appropriate pest levels, called action limits, and use controls where the thresholds are crossed. Knowledge of these thresholds and dynamics of pests and natural enemies helps to avoid unnecessary (chemical) interventions. Some termite control service technicians even repair structural damage caused by termites.</p>

After you have actually determined the tolerance level (likewise called the threshold), you may choose a pest management choice that will keep damage listed below that level.
