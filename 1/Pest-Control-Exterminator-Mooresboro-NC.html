SWPM is vulnerable to attack by wood dull insects which, in a collection environment, may trigger severe damage to structures, office furniture, specimens and artifacts. Applicators perform more intricate tasks, are able to utilize a wider range of pesticides, and might concentrate on a specific area of pest control.</p>
