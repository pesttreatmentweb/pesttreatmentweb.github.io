<p>For some tasks, pest control workers utilize a mix of pest management methods, a practice known as integrated pest management. The cornerstone of a reliable IPM program is a schedule of regular inspections. Crop losses due to weeds, illness, and arthropods, though disputed by some as a legitimate measure, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) in spite of the surge of pest control.</p>
<p>Understanding what your plants require-- and supplying all they need-- offers you the upper hand over pests. As the specified objective of an IPM system is to get rid of or at least attenuate the economic impact of pests, effectiveness in the decrease of pest populations is a primary sign of efficiency of the system.

<p>Biological control has been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address intrusive pest issues, classical biological control method is usually utilized where natural enemies from the native area of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and launched in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control strategy that has actually been efficiently used versus a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
