<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and some of the pesticides used in a natural system are as harmful to human beings and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides. Pest control specialists can just do so much to protect the food supply," says Dr. Zia Siddiqi, Director of Quality Systems at Orkin The fact is, food business operators have to take an active role in integrated pest management by working closely with the specialists.</p>
<p>Cockroaches, also known as waterbugs, croton bugs, or palmetto bugs, destroy food and damage fabrics, book bindings, and other products. They can breed in the gelatinous bacterial movies-- biofilms-- that form on surface areas in drains, sewage-disposal tanks, compost, etc, and are resistant to cleaning and pest-control chemicals. Let Pest Control Service take care of any of your bed bug problems.</p>
<p>Likewise, consider how the variety of plants to be grown in the exact same location may affect ease of pesticide applications and spread of disease. Pest control pertains to non-lethal methods too, such as keeping the area free and clean of any food debris or other attractants, sealing up entry methods such as cracks in walls or the area between the bottom of a door and the flooring.</p>
<p>In contrast, natural food production applies many of the very same ideas as IPM but limits using pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, instead of synthetic chemicals. Other claims consist of reductions in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to lower the requirement for other, less ecologically favorable, herbicides.</p>
