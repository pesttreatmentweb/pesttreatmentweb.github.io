IPM is the selection and usage of pest control actions that will ensure favourable financial condition, social and ecological repercussions 13 and is applicable to many farming, public health and feature pest management circumstances.</p>
<p>They mainly utilize natural methods and pesticides that are analyzed and certified and are protected for usage and do not have any hazardous effects on the environment.
