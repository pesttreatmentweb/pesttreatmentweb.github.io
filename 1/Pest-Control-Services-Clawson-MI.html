<p>Although botanical extracts such as azadirachtin and pyrethrins, and microbe-derived poisonous metabolites such as avermectin and spinosad are considered biologicals (Lasota and Dybas 1991, Sarfraz et al. 2005, Dodia et al. 2010 ), they are still chemical molecules, similar to synthetic chemicals, and possess many of the ecological and human safety threats as chemical pesticides.</p>
