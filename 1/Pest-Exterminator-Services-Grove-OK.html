<p>Biological control has actually been successfully utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To resolve invasive pest concerns, classical biological control approach is generally used where natural enemies from the native region of the intrusive pest are imported, increased, and launched in the brand-new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ).
