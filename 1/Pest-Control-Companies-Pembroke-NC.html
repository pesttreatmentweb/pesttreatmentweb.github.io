However, the high potential for reproduction of insect pests remains, and a population surge of lots of species can be anticipated from a low-density level whenever ideal ecological conditions take place or control slackens. Under this scheme, insect control was "supervised" by qualified entomologists, and insecticide applications were based on conclusions reached from routine tracking of pest and natural-enemy populations.</p>
