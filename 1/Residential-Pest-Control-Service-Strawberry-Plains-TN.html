<p>Socio-psychological elements including moral and rational considerations were discovered to the chauffeurs in IPM implementation in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A survey of veggie growers in Sri Lanka revealed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or illness event and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ).
