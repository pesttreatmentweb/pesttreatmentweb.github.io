<p>Pesticides are selected and used in a way that minimizes their possible damage to individuals, nontarget organisms, and the environment. IPM is probably to be misconstrued as pest management without chemicals which in truth need based use of chemicals. Pests can be brought into the food processing facility through the supply chain, in the components or product packaging, and the facility itself will bring in pests through food odours and lighting.</p>
