<p>Below ground termites are the most damaging termites in the United States. Diseases or pests can be present in a crop without causing economic damage. Accuracy applications of low toxicity pesticides rather than common baseboard applications or treatment of an entire property likewise have proven to greatly decrease the overall volumes of pesticides used. Insect pests frequently have natural opponents that are advantageous to the landscape.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural enemies and discourage pest determination include intercropping (several crops in the same field) to make it harder for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which bring in pests away from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to coincide with times where pests have emerged and died off for the season.</p>
