<p>As part of the Sustainable Usage Instruction on Pesticides, expert users of pesticides are needed to think about the concepts of IPM prior to using chemicals. Biological pest control is a method of managing pests such as insects and mites by utilizing other organisms 8 It depends on predation, parasitism, herbivory or other natural systems, however generally also involves an active human management function.</p>
<p>A normal mistake most services encounter is describing their business name too actually by using tired pest control terms like control, pesticide, insecticide, and management. The pest management industry is large, with over 15,000 companies serving the public and around 150,000 pest control service workers. Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, vermins, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow jackets, flies and bees are commonly found pests in our society.</p>
<p>Other pesticides, like surface sprays and termite treatments, linger in the environment for days, weeks or perhaps longer after application. 9 Biological control can be an important part of an integrated pest management program. But by concentrating on non-chemical options first, you can make sure that your pest management program is efficiently getting rid of pests at the least risk to your food safety program, non-target organisms and the environment.</p>
