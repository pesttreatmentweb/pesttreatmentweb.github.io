Due to the fact that they are generally more effective and can normally be utilized to control a number of pests, the majority of insecticides fall into the chemical classification. Physical barriers such as fences, webs, mulch, and tree trunk guards can exclude pests and minimize the damage they inflict.</p>

Federal government guidelines limit the time and quantity of particular chemical pesticides and help mitigate the associated threats.</p>
