If a number of the pests are eliminated, then any that have resistance to the chemical will form the genetic basis of the future, more resistant, population. While chemical pesticides should be utilized as the last option, in principle, in some cases they are the first line of defense to prevent the area-wide spread of certain endemic or intrusive pests and diseases or to protect the seed and transplants from common and relentless pest issues.</p>
