<p>Natural opponents such as parasitic wasps and predatory arthropods can be extremely efficient in triggering substantial decreases in pest populations in particular circumstances (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ).

Expert exterminators utilize different kinds of pesticides and baits to eliminate and eliminate pests. Efficient, permanent restorative actions can then be required to prevent pests from going into the structure and infesting the building and collections.</p>
