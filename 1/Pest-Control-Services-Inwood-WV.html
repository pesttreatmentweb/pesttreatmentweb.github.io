<p>Biological pest control measures take advantage of the hierarchy within nature. IPM programs preliminary task is to establish appropriate pest levels, called action limits, and apply controls where the limits are crossed. Knowledge of these thresholds and characteristics of pests and natural opponents assists to prevent unneeded (chemical) interventions.
