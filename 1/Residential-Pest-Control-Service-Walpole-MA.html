<p>Likewise, consider how the range of plants to be grown in the very same area might influence ease of pesticide applications and spread of illness.

<p>Diseases or pests can be present in a crop without causing economic damage. Precision applications of low toxicity pesticides instead of typical baseboard applications or treatment of an entire property also have actually shown to greatly reduce the overall volumes of pesticides applied.
