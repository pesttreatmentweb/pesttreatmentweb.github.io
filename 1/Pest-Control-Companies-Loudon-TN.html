<p>4 ). With its success in lots of parts of the world, IPM is viewed as a ecologically benign and affordable  pest control technique preferably matched for both little and large farmers around the world. Once termites have entered a building, they do not limit themselves to wood; they also damage paper, cloth, carpets and more. In some ways, IPM can be considered as a decision-making process in which observations (from evaluation and tracking) are used to make pest control choices based on pre-determined management objectives.</p>
<p>Biological control has actually been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To deal with intrusive pest issues, classical biological control technique is usually used where natural opponents from the native area of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the brand-new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control method that has been successfully used versus a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>Throughout the dispute on alternative approaches for managing pests, various concepts have been revealed and new techniques have actually emerged. What is thought about an excellent IPM program today might be considered a chemical extensive program in a couple of years. Use proper crop rotation practices and target pests with numerous modes of action to make it harder for pests to adapt.</p>
