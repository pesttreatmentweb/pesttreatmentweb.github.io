<p>Pest management requires a holistic method to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are applied only after regular tracking shows that a pest population had actually reached a financial threshold level. Numerous specific commodity growers, for such crop as strawberries and potatoes, are working to define what IPM indicates for their crop and area, and IPM-labeled foods are available in minimal locations.</p>
<p>Monitoring and identification decreases the risks of using the incorrect type of pesticide, or using pesticides when other techniques will be more efficient. The benefit of the misting pest control method is that it's considered to be eco-friendly, it's odorless and does not leave any residues that are hard to be cleaned. Cultural practices - count on a method to make the crop or habitat inappropriate to pests by interfering with their oviposition preferences, host plant discrimination or area by both immatures and grownups.</p>
