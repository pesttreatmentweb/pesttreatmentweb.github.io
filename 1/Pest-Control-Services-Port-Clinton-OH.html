As soon as termites have actually gotten in a building, they do not limit themselves to wood; they also damage paper, cloth, carpets and more. In some methods, IPM can be considered as a decision-making process in which observations (from examination and monitoring) are utilized to make pest control choices based on pre-determined management objectives.</p>
<p>Benefit from previous experience by focusing on plant types that tend to be susceptible to arthropod pests.
