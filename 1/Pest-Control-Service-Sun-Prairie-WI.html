<p>Pest Management truth sheets Information on arthropod pest abundance, area within the greenhouse, and population patterns (increases, decreases, or stable) aid figure out the efficiency of pest management tactics.

<p>New generation of GPS, sensors-fitted farm devices, e-tablets, and mobile applications (Plantix) might be utilized for future pests and illness identification and tracking 47 Because execution of IPM programs depends mainly on information, it is expected that a giant action being taken in locations such as concepts of insect sampling, computer system shows and mathematics, understanding of pests biological and ecological aspects, and simulation methods and modeling 11 In addition, meteorological and geostatistical computer system designs can change forecasting and tracking of insect pests, which, ultimately improve decision-making for IPM.</p>
