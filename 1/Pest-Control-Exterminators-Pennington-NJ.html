<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and some of the pesticides used in a natural system are as harmful to humans and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides.

<p>These unknown or badly comprehended potential risks argue for additional levels of protection including exposures to several pesticides, in the house, at school and in the diet; direct exposure to chemicals in mix with pesticides such as pharmaceuticals, commercial compounds and individual care products; and the basic trouble in attributing chronic diseases to any one particular cause.</p>
<p>The lots of varying dangers from pests make it recommended for cultural heritage companies to establish an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their collections and structures.
