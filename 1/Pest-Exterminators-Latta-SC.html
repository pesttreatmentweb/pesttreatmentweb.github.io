<p>Pesticides are picked and applied in a way that minimizes their possible harm to individuals, nontarget organisms, and the environment. IPM is more than likely to be misunderstood as pest management without chemicals which in fact requirement based usage of chemicals. Pests can be brought into the food processing facility through the supply chain, in the components or product packaging, and the center itself will draw in pests through food odours and lighting.</p>
<p>Other pesticides, like surface sprays and termite treatments, remain in the environment for days, weeks and even longer after application. 9 Biological control can be a crucial component of an incorporated pest management program. But by focusing on non-chemical options first, you can make sure that your pest management program is effectively eliminating pests at the least danger to your food security program, non-target organisms and the environment.</p>
