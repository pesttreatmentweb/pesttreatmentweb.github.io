<p>We historically have actually sold nature short, both in its capability to reduce the effects of the effectiveness of ecologically unsound techniques along with its range of intrinsic strengths that can be utilized to keep pest organisms within bounds.

<p>Natural opponents such as parasitic wasps and predatory arthropods can be very effective in triggering considerable decreases in pest populations in specific circumstances (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ). Periodical releases of commercially readily available natural opponents or saving natural opponent populations by providing havens or preventing practices that damage them are a few of the typical practices to control endemic pests.</p>
