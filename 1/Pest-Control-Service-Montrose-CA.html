TAP insulation for attics, moisture barriers for crawl spaces, and specifically crafted weather condition stripping for garage and entry doors not only discourage rodents and other damaging pests from getting in and living in your house, they're energy efficient, too.</p>
<p>We got 195 mention of 200 in Integrated Pest Management. Pests are drawn in to several locations that can offer any of thefollowing: food, water, shelter or all 3.

While chemical pesticides need to be utilized as the last resort, in concept, in some cases they are the first line of defense to prevent the area-wide spread of specific endemic or intrusive pests and illness or to safeguard the seed and transplants from common and consistent pest issues.</p>
